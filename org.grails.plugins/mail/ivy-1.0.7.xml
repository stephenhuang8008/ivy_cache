		This plug-in provides a MailService class as well as configuring the necessary beans within
the Spring ApplicationContext.

It also adds a &quot;sendMail&quot; method to all controller classes. A typical example usage is:

sendMail {
    to &quot;fred@g2one.com&quot;,&quot;ginger@g2one.com&quot;
    from &quot;john@g2one.com&quot;
    cc &quot;marge@g2one.com&quot;, &quot;ed@g2one.com&quot;
    bcc &quot;joe@g2one.com&quot;
    subject &quot;Hello John&quot;
    text &quot;this is some text&quot;
}
